  abstract= {We prove that the scalar curvature is a rigid invariant for complete maximal spacelike p-submanifolds in the pseudo-hyperbolic space Hp,q. We characterize the p-submanifolds achieving the bound and study the hyperbolicity of maximal p-submanifolds of Hp,q. In codimension q=1, we deduce a rigidity result concerning the Ricci curvature of maximal hypersurfaces in anti-de Sitter spaces.},

  abstract={We study entire spacelike constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in Anti-de Sitter space of any dimension. First, we give a classification result with respect to their asymptotic boundary, namely we show that every admissible sphere \(\Lambda\) is the boundary of a unique such hypersurface, for any given value \(H\) of the mean curvature. We also demonstrate that, as \(H\) varies in \(\mathbb{R}\), these hypersurfaces analytically foliate the invisible domain of \(\Lambda\). Finally, we extend Cheng-Yau Theorem to the Anti-de Sitter space, which establishes the completeness of any entire constant mean curvature hypersurface.},

  abstract={In this note we develop a half-space model for the pseudo-hyperbolic space \(\mathbb{H}^{p,q}\), for any \(p,q\) with \(p\geq 1\). This half-space model embeds isometrically onto the complement of a degenerate totally geodesic hyperplane in \(\mathbb{H}^{p,q}\). We describe the geodesics, the totally geodesic submanifolds, the horospheres, the isometry group in the half-space model, and we explain how to interpret the boundary at infinity in this setting.},
