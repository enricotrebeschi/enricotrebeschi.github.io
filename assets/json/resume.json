In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."},{"name":"Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1916-03-20","url":"https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_Grundlage_der_allgemeinen_Relativitätstheorie","summary":"The publication of the theory of general relativity made him internationally famous.
